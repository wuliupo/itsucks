		The most important new features are the pause feature and that advanced filter are 
		re-editable after creating them. Also very interesting is the new console interface. 
		Create your download using the GUI and save it as download template. 
		The download can be started later on the console with 'java -jar itsucks-console-0.2.0-pre8.jar &lt;download template&gt;'. 
		Many bugfixes are included as well.
